# Class presentation requirements

**Tuesday April 26 PT09: Erik, Jared F**

**The purpose of this presentation is to let anyone in the class know about your project.**
To introduce your project you will have **max 7 minutes (including some brief Q&A).**

Prepare your presentation using your Project parts P1, P2, and P3.
If you already have code implemented you could also show some brief parts of your prototype "in action" (executing code - either in a video or as a mini live demo), but this is not mandatory.

You do not have to cover all the minute details of your project,
**it is more important to clearly present the "big picture" of your project**, i.e.
* what's the project about
* motivation/need/origin of the idea
* main characteristics and functionality
* proposed solution
* main results expected
* make your presentation interesting and informative. 

All team members of a project group must be involved in preparing and presenting this class project talk.
In principle, being a team effort, all team members will receive the same grade for this presentation,
although depending on circumstances the instructor may decide to give different grades to different team members.
